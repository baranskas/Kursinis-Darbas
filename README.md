## Restaurant Tycoon
### Dependencies

### Idea
Thrilling restaurant management game where you'll immerse yourself in the fast-paced world of culinary chaos! In this web-based adventure developed in Python, you'll step into the shoes of a restaurant manager, tasked with handling orders and delivering delectable dishes to eager customers within strict time limits.
 
 ### How to play?
 You can clone the repository, install the necessary dependencies and run `python main.py`. It will launch a local server at 127.0.0.1:5050 (or similar port).

### Design patterns used in the code
## Singleton
In this snippet of the code, we use Singleton object in order to ensure, that the restaurant object is created only once. The object itself holds crucial data for the game such as: Points, lives and live management.
